Installation

    The CUT Framework is completely implemented in the <cut> and
<cut.H> header files; only access to those files is necessary to use
CUT.  Therefore, building and installing is very simple; to install,
run:

	./configure		# does nothing.
	make			# builds optional unit test object, and distribution package
	make install		# copies header files to /usr/local/include

    The default installation target is /usr/local/include/; you will
likely require root priviledges to install there.

    To build and execute the (optional) CUT unit tests, run:

	make test
