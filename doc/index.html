The Enbridge Inc. &quot;CUT&quot; C++ Unit Test Framework

</FONT></P>

<P> CUT is designed to make C++ unit testing as simple as possible,
without sacrificing the ability to handle complex C++ constructs such
as exceptions, templates and threads.</P>

<P>In particular, it avoids most (if not all) of the painful reasons that
people don't do unit testing in C++.</P>

<P> Unlike other C++ unit testing frameworks, CUT: </P>

<UL>

<LI><P> Requires no compilation.  It is implemented in a single
standard C++ header file.  No painful changes to makefiles required.
Just add this to this to the <I>end</I> (so it doesn't clutter up your
code or namespaces) of any C++ files you want to put some unit tests in:</P>

<PRE>
#if defined( TEST )
#  include &lt;cut&gt;
namespace cut {
    // CUT Unit Tests go here...
}
#endif
</PRE>

<LI><P> Requires no explicit test linkage.  Unit tests for code are
created right nearby the code they test, and are
<I>automatically</I> linked into the executable if the code's object
file is linked!</P>

<P> OK, you missed that.  Read it again.  They are
<I><B>auto</B>matically</I> included in your program, if your
program happens to link in the related code!  They are
<B>not</B> included, automatically, if your program doesn't use the
code.  You never have to remember to "link in" the new test, or take
it out.   You just get all the tests for all the code you use, and nothing else. </P>

<P> Just add this to the top of the main C++ file: </P>

<PRE>
#if defined( TEST )
#  include &lt;cut&gt;
namespace cut {
     test root( "My Program's Unit Tests" );
}
#endif
</PRE>

<P> There.  You've just created the cut::test object named 'root',
which you will chain all your othere tests to.  Unless otherwise
specified, you are going to run all the test suites chained to this
'root' test suite. </P>

<LI><P> Comes with predefined CUT test suite "runner" classes that
emit regular HTML, CGI HTML or plain text.  It is quite straight
forward to create new test suite &quot;cut::runner&quot; classes, to
output test results in any format you desire.  Even to your new,
custom super-dooper IGTP (Inter-Galactic Transfer Protocol) client.
No changes to your test code required. </P>

<P> So, set up your program to run your unit tests: </P>

<PRE>
main( int argc, char **argv ) {
    bool run_unit_tests = false;
    // Check argc/argv options here, and set run_unit_tests...
#if defined( TEST )
    if ( run_unit_tests ) {
        cut::runner		textrunner( std::cout );
        textrunner.run( cut::root );
    }
#endif
    // Do your regular program stuff here...
}
</PRE>

<P> However, you may find that your unit tests run so fast, that you
just always want to run them (whenever you compile with "-DTEST"): </P>

<PRE>
main( int argc, char **argv )
{
#if defined( TEST )
    // Run unit tests (cut::root, by default), complaining if any fail...
    cut::runner( std::cout ).run();
#endif
    // Do your regular program stuff here...
}
</PRE>

<LI><P> No "testing" classes to create.  Don't spend your time writing
<A
HREF="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/cppunit_cookbook.html">boiler-plate</A>
derivations of test classes.  To add a new cut::test instance variable
'my_test', under suite 'root', named "My Test", type: </P>

<PRE>
CUT( root, my_test, "My Test" ) {
    // my test code...
}
</PRE>

<P> No, you didn't miss something important.  That's <I>it</I>. </P>

<LI><P> No complicated test suite "set-up" or "tear-down" mechanism is
required.  Any test suite can (explicitly) run any other test suite
(either by name: "My Test", or by instance: 'cut::my_test').  Just write a
"generic" test suite, and then write some more test suite(s) that
perform whatever "set-up" you want, run the "generic" suite, and then
"tear-down" (see <A HREF="../cut-test.C">cut-test.C</A> for an example): </P>

<PRE>
namespace cut {
    // First, create a root for a suite of "generic" tests,
    // you want to run with many different "set-ups".
    test generic( "Generic Tests" );

    // You can chain suites under 'generic'...
    CUT( generic, generic_suite_1, "Generic Suite 1" ) {
    }
    // ...as deep as you want!  Just like under 'cut::root'.
    CUT( generic_suite_1, more_generic_tests, "Some More Tests" ) {
    }

    // Then, chain some test suites under 'cut::root', and call 'generic'
    // with as many different test "set-ups" as you want!
    CUT( root, setup_1, "Setup 1" ) {
        // test 1 "set-up"
	assert.run( generic );
        // test 1 "tear-down"
    }
    CUT( root, setup_2, "Setup 2" ) {
        // test 2 "set-up"
	assert.run( generic );
        // test 2 "tear-down"
    }

    // Better yet, loop and synthesize random test "set-ups" for each 'generic' run.
    CUT( root, setup_random, "Setup Random" ) {
        for ( int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i ) {
	    // Some random setup
	    assert.run( generic )
	    // "tear-down" what we just set-up!
	}
    }
} // namespace cut
</PRE>

<LI><P> Test cases are simple to specify; even if you don't yet know
the expected result yet!  Only the most trivial programs have output
that you can calculate a-priori (otherwise, why would you be writing
the program?)  Write test suite output to std::cout (it is redirected
to wherever the current "cut::runner" wants it to go).  Just write the
tests cases, check the results later, and put in the expected values
later (see <A HREF="../test-twofiles-2.C">test-twofiles-2.C</A> for an
example): </P>
</P>

<PRE>
namespace cut {
    CUT( root, calculation_test "Calculation" ) {
        std::cout << "Fill this in later!" << std::endl;
        assert.ISUNKNOWN( sqrt( 2 ) );
    }
}
</PRE>

<P> Testing of any type that has -, *, /, -'ve, < and <= implemented,
and is convertible to double or std::string is supported: </P>


</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=5>
<B>How-to</B>
</FONT></P>

<P> Here is a complete standalone CUT unit test, which actually runs
its unit tests as CGI HTML, or as plain text.  See cut.H for more
detailed instructions.</P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;cut&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

namespace cut {
    test                        root( &quot;How-To Tests&quot; );

    CUT( root, FirstSuite, &quot;The First Suite&quot; ) {
        assert.out() &lt;&lt; &quot;Success: &quot; &lt;&lt; name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        assert.ISTRUE( true );
    }
}

int
main( int, char ** ) {
    bool success;
    if ( getenv( "REQUEST_METHOD" )) {
        // 
        // Lets run our tests with CGI HTML output:
        // 
        //                            target  sparse  flat   cgi
        //                            ------  ------  ----   ---
        success = cut::htmlrunner( std::cout, false,  true,  true ).run();
    } else {
        // 
        // But, here's the (simpler) textual output:
        // 
        success = cut::runner( std::cout ).run();
    }
    return ! success;
}
</PRE>

<P> Now, lets imagine that you wanted to add a couple more unit tests,
in some other compilation unit.  All you would do is add the following
code to that file (note that you can use either assert.out() or
std::cout to log test suite output, but you should probably be
consistent; assert.out() goes to whatever std::ostream was passed to
the cut::runner): </P>

<PRE>
#include &lt;cut&gt;

namespace cut {
    CUT( cut::root, SecondSuite, &quot;The Second Suite&quot; ) {
	assert.out() &lt;&lt; &quot;Failure: &quot; &lt;&lt; name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	assert.ISTRUE( false );
    }

    CUT( cut::root, ThirdSuite, &quot;The Third Suite&quot; ) {
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Unknown: &quot; &lt;&lt; name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	assert.ISUNKNOWN( true );
    }
}</PRE>

<P> That's it!  No other house-keeping is required.  If the second
compilation unit is linked, its tests will also be linked, and they
will all be run. </P>

<P> Click the following link to generate the output of the above unit
tests (remember, all tests are run 3 times, here, and all tests are
output.  Normally, only non-successful tests would be output): </P>

<A HREF="http://enbridge.kundert.ca/cgi-bin/cut/test-twofiles">http://enbridge.kundert.ca/cgi-bin/cut/test-twofiles</A>

<P> Here is the output from another CUT unit test.  Once again, all of the
unit tests are run multiple times, and output in several different
forms: </P>

<P> Finally, here is the unit test suite for the enbridge REF
Reference Counting Pointer Framework, which runs about 2.2 million
individual test cases.  Remember, all of these tests are actually
being run when you click these links, and are generating the HTML
output you see! </P>
